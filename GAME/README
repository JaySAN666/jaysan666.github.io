A modified version of the tutorial provided by w3schools

https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp

Improvements include

1) The ability to use the WASD Keys to move along with the arrow keys to move the player around
2) Once the game is over, there is an alert saying that the game is over instead of suddenly stopping
3) There is a button to restart the game when the player loses
4) There are two increases of difficulty once the player reaches a certain score(at 500 and 1000)
